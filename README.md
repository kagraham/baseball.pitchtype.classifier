# baseball.pitchtype.classifier

Baseball pitchers throw a plethora of different pitches to a hitter, all with an objective of keeping a hitter off-balanced to induce an out. Of the seven different pitch types in pitchclassificationtrain.csv, can you train and test a model to classify pitches based on the variables provided?

For this project, I took the pitchclassificationtrain.csv file and split it into a train and test dataset. Using two supervised ML methods, K-nearest neighbors and decision tree, I built and tested the accuracy of the model.

Work is located in pitch.py

Figs include figures used for data exploration

Model output is in pitchtype_prediction.csv
